------------------------------------------------------
SELECT id, date, location, description

-- üåë Under the guise of revelry, the garden hides a grim scene.
-- Witnesses whisper of a hotel booking and phone calls ringing
-- with secrets that won't stay silent.

-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 2: Witness Statements
-- The shadows deepen with whispers from the masked guests.
-- Time to unravel the clues hidden in witness statements.
------------------------------------------------------
SELECT ws.crime_scene_id, ws.witness_id, ws.clue
FROM witness_statements ws
INNER JOIN crime_scene cs ON ws.crime_scene_id = cs.id
WHERE date = 19871031
  AND LOWER(location) LIKE '%coconut grove%';

-- üïØÔ∏è The whispers grow louder in the dim light.
-- Witnesses spill the secrets:
--     ‚Ä¢ A booking at The Grand Regency lingers like smoke in the air.
--     ‚Ä¢ Room 707, reserved just yesterday, holds a shadowed guest.
-- The trail leads us there‚Äîtime to unmask who checked in under the veil of night.

-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 3: The Guest List Emerges
-- The door swings open on Room 707 at The Grand Regency.
-- Names step into the light‚Äîguests no longer shadows behind masks.
-- Time to see who‚Äôs behind this room number, and what secrets they carry.

  AND hc.room_number = 707;

-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 4: Surveillance and Phone Logs
-- The midnight whispers grow louder‚Äîshadowy figures caught on camera,
-- and phone lines buzzing with secrets frozen in time.
-- Surveillance notes and phone records from The Grand Regency,
-- Room 707, the night before the masquerade.
-- Let‚Äôs eavesdrop on what was really said and seen.

-- One voice presses the questions hard:
-- ‚ÄúDid you kill him?‚Äù
-- ‚ÄúWhy did you kill him, bro? You should have left the carpenter to his craft.‚Äù
-- The weight of these questions hangs heavy in the silence.

-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 5: Following the Call to a Confession
-- The line rings through The Grand Regency,
-- leading us to the listener‚Äîand their final words.
-- We've traced the recipient of that pointed call,
-- now to see if their confession breaks the silence.

-- The first interview yields a twist:
-- The recipient denies the deed but drops a vital hint‚Äî
-- The true murderer is a carpenter behind the wheel of a Lamborghini.
-- The trail sharpens; the game is far from over.

-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 6: The Carpenter‚Äôs Ride
-- The hint points straight to the driver of the fast machine‚Äî
-- A carpenter with a Lamborghini, cruising under suspicion‚Äôs glare.
-- Let‚Äôs shine the spotlight on this flashy suspect.
------------------------------------------------------
SELECT p.*
FROM person p
INNER JOIN vehicle_registry vr ON p.id = vr.person_id
