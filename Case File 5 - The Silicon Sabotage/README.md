## 📘 Case Brief

The halls of QuantumTech pulsed with anticipation. On the eve of unveiling the revolutionary "QuantaX" microprocessor, disaster struck: the prototype was destroyed, and every shred of research data vanished into thin air. 
Eyewitnesses spoke of hurried footsteps and suspicious logins. Corporate espionage is suspected.  
It’s up to you, detective, to follow the data trails through glowing server rooms, swipe-card doors, and inboxes stuffed with secrets.

This won’t be a simple caper—expect complex joins, forensic filtering, and classic deductive logic before the saboteur is unmasked.
